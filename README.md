Remove Bloat from Windows 10  This batch file can be used to remove tracking/telemetry, data collection and default apps from Windows 10. It's a compilation of several scripts into a single batch file based on what I considered useful. Download HERE, then remove the ".txt" extension and run as Admin. Use at your own risk!

## Remove Bloat from Windows 10 & Debloat it like it's Android ROM by turning off SpyWare and Microsoft Telemetry Services

This batch file can be used to remove tracking/telemetry, data collection and default apps from Windows 10.
It's a compilation of several scripts into a single batch file based on what I considered useful.
**[Download RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt "Download RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt"), then remove the ".txt"** extension(so it looks like "_RemoveW10Bloat.bat_") and **run as Admin.**
Use at your own risk! Customize as you wish. 

In case you want **_to put things back & UNDO the process _**, **[HERE's](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "UNDO PROCES SCRIPT HERE")**. The reverse script (remove the ".txt" extension and **run as Admin).**

## BOTH SCRIPTS DELETE *.txt extension and _RIGHTCLICK + RUN AS ADMIN_

1. **Right-Click & Run As Admin** fires the script as *.bat in Command Prompt, after finishing restart your PC.
2. If you wanna execute script as per 1-by-1 service or task and not all, just edit _**RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt**_ with some txt editor(eg. Notepad++ or SublimeText or just Notepad) remove the lines you dont want to execute or add some more if you need them & save it back to FileName.bat(remove/rename *.txt into eg. RemoveW10Bloat.bat) - execute as described by RightClicking it and Run As Admin, reboot PC after and check the services and tasks usually RUNNING in processes tree or services window.
3. **[UNDO](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "UNDO PROCES SCRIPT")** & Reverse the proces, just Download the **_[PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt")_ & UNDO the process SCRIPT from above.**
