### Instructions: Naming Convention, Editing, Running Batch scripts.

It's a custom scripts & Service disabling code added into _1-per-line-tweak_ & compiled into a single batch file based on what I considered is useful and plan to add, edit & improve it on a daily basis. Download example and try it from **[Download HERE ->> RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt "Download RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt") , then remove the ".txt" extension and run as Admin. Use at your own risk! Customize as you wish. In case you want to put things back, here's the reverse/Undo script(remove the ".txt" extension and run as Admin as well).
[UNDO process in 1-Click](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "UNDO process in 1-Click").

## Remove Bloat from Windows 10 & disable SpyWare,tracking, logging or Telemetry Services well known as "Win.10 SpyWare OS".

This batch file can be used to remove tracking/telemetry, data collection and default apps from Windows 10.
It's a compilation of several scripts into a single batch file based on what I considered useful.
**[Download RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt "Download RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt"), then remove the ".txt"** extension(so it looks like "_**RemoveW10Bloat.bat**_") and **run as Admin.**
Use at your own risk! Customize it as you wish. 

In case you want to put things back & [UNDO process in 1-Click](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "UNDO process in 1-Click") [PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "UNDO SCRIPT with PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt"). The reverse script(remove the **".txt" extension** and **Right-Click + Run As Admin).**

### Both Scripts Usage & Tips: Delete (.txt) suffix extension and leave it in FileName.bat FileFormat, Save it & Run As Admin, this FileName.* convention & formatting style(eg. RENAME it from/to: PutBackW10Bloat.bat_**.txt**_ to PutBackW10Bloat_**.bat**_ or YourNEwScriptName_**.bat**_).

1. **Right-Click & Run As Admin** fires the script as *.bat in Command Prompt, after finishing restart your PC.
2. If you wanna execute script as 1-by-1 service or task per line and not all, just edit _**RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt**_ with some txt editor(eg. _**Notepad++, SublimeText, Windows Notepad, anyTxtEditorYouHave...**_) remove the lines you dont want to execute or add some more if you need them & save it back to FileName.bat(remove *.txt suffix like here **_RemoveW10Bloat.bat_**) & execute as described by RightClicking it + Run As Admin, reboot PC after and check the services and tasks usually RUNNING in processes tree or services window.
3. **[UNDO & Reverse the proces](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "UNDO  & Reverse the proces")**, just Download the **_[PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt")_ & UNDO the process SCRIPT from above.**
4. Ask for pull-requests if you your edit it or get some progress in any way, pasy asttention some of the Services are constantly renamed every Update(Microsoft Telemetry for example). make sure youu check whats new and update scripts & make changes, make Pull Request - will update it once a week in Master branch.

Cheers and ask if you need help or have suggestions and need more custom stuff. Feel FREE to Fork it, develop it & improve it - get some more Tweaks and Cleaner functionality:
Disabling, Blocking, Deleting and Firewalling those MS suckers is one of the ways to ensure your HDD/SSD not Fail in few months by overloading after Windows reboot every time... JUST CHECK YOUR HARD DISK USAGE LED and TaskManager + SORT BY DISK USAGE Before YouUse SCRIPT --> YOU WIL BE AMAZED that every Reboot you make just TURN ON "Task Manager" to verify that your DISK USAGE is not 100% for 10-15mins. after every single Desktop loaded and this Tweaks works great so no harm on OS is made, SSD/HDD does not drill in idle state as you thought and usage is normalized.
