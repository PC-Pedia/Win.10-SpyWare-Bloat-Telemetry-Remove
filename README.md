It's a custom scripts & Service disabling code added into _1-per-line-tweak_ & compiled into a single batch file based on what I considered is useful and plan to add, edit & improve it on a daily basis. Download example and try it from **[Download HERE ->> RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt "Download RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt") , then remove the ".txt" extension and run as Admin.

### Remove Bloat from Windows 10 & disable SpyWare,tracking, logging or Telemetry Services well known as "Win.10 SpyWare OS".

This batch file can be used to remove tracking/telemetry, data collection and default apps from Windows 10.
It's a compilation of several scripts into a single batch file based on what I considered useful.
**[Download RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt "Download RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt"), then remove the ".txt"** extension(so it looks like "_**RemoveW10Bloat.bat**_") and **run as Admin.**
Use at your own risk! Customize it as you wish. 

In case you want to put things back & [UNDO process in 1-Click](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "UNDO process in 1-Click") [PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "UNDO SCRIPT with PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt"). The reverse script(remove the **".txt" extension** and **Right-Click + Run As Admin).**

#### Both Scripts Usage & Tips: Delete (.txt) suffix/extension and leave it in FileName_**.bat**_ FileFormat, Save it & Run As Admin, this FileName.* convention/formatting style(eg. RENAME it from/to:
PutBackW10Bloat.bat_**.txt**_ to PutBackW10Bloat_**.bat**_ or YourNEwScriptName_**.bat**_).

#### 1. **Right-Click & Run As Admin** fires the script as *.bat in Command Prompt, after finishing restart your PC.

#### 2. If you wanna execute script as 1-by-1 service or task per line and not all, just edit _**RemoveW10Bloat.bat.txt**_ with some txt editor(eg. _**Notepad++, SublimeText, Windows Notepad, anyTxtEditorYouHave...**_).
Remove the lines you dont want to execute or add some more if you need them & save it back to FileName.bat(remove *.txt suffix like here **_RemoveW10Bloat.bat_**) & execute as described by RightClicking it + Run As Admin, reboot PC after and check the services and tasks usually RUNNING in processes tree or services window.

#### 3. **[UNDO & Reverse the proces](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "UNDO  & Reverse the proces")**,
just Download the
**_[PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt](https://github.com/komodev/RemoveW10Bloat/blob/master/PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt "PutBackW10Bloat.bat.txt")_ & UNDO the process SCRIPT from above.**

#### 4. Ask for pull-requests if you edit it or get some progress, pay attention to some of the Services, they are renamed every Update(eg. Microsoft Telemetry).
Make sure youu check what's new and update scripts, make changes, make Pull Request etc. - will update it once a week in Master branch. all feedback and help is welcome.
